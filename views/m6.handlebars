<h2> Updates to Prototype: </h2>
<h3> 1. Ephemerality </h3>
The biggest new feature we added is ephemerality. We felt that this would make users much more comfortable being recorded based on our user tests last week. We also think it will make the users enjoy their friends' reactions more if they know they can never watch them again. The reaction videos are completely deleted after the user views them once. This feature will be something we examine closely in our user tests next week.

<h3>2. Removed email feature</h3>
We felt that the auto-generated email feature was the main contributor the the 'spammy' feeling of our site in the last iteration so we removed it completely. From the user tests we found that it was faster and less creepy to simply send a link so there was no point in keeping the email feature at all
<br>
<h3>3. Video upload on enter</h3>
We found that users wanted to simply press 'enter' once they had pasted the link instead of pressing the submit button so we enabled this action
<br>
<h3> 4. Forced recording </h3>
We added a feature that requires users to turn on the camera before they can watch the video. In the user tests we found many users did not know how turn the camera on so we added a very visible prompt. We want to see if users are comfortable with turning the camera on if it is required or if this will creep out the users who would have not turned it on in the last iteration
<br>
<h3>5. Resize videos </h3>
We resized reaction videos relative to the youtube video and placed them on top of the youtube video. We found from testing that users were much more interested in watching their friends reactions than in rewatching the youtube video so we made the reaction videos the focal point once they appear
<br>
<h3>6. Clicking on reaction videos </h3>
Now when a user clicks on the youtube play button or on any of the reaction videos they all start to play. The most common 'mistake' users made in the test last week was to click on the reaction videos to make them play so this is clearly the most intuitive action for users.
<br>
<h3>7. Style </h3>
We added some styling and a logo to our page to make it look less spammy and to make users more comfortable recording themselves on our site </h3>
<br>
<h3>8. Limit number of reaction videos to 3 </h3>
We found that users could not focus on more than 3 videos so we do not display more than 3 reaction videos at once </h3>
<br>
<h3>9. Small changes </h3>
We also made some small changes to text on the site to more clearly explain our features and to make buttons more intuitive.
