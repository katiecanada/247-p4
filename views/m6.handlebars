<h2> Updates to Prototype: </h2>
<h3> 1. Ephemerality </h3>
The biggest new feature we added is ephemerality. We felt that this would make users much more comfortable being recorded based on our user tests last week. We also think it will make the users enjoy their friends' reactions more if they know they can never watch them again. The reaction videos are completely deleted after the user views them once. This feature will be something we examine closely in our user tests next week.

<h3>2. Removed email feature</h3>
We felt that the auto-generated email feature was the main contributor the the 'spammy' feeling of our site in the last iteration so we removed it completely. From the user tests we found that it was faster and less creepy to simply send a link so there was no point in keeping the email feature at all. 
<br>
<h3>3. Video upload on enter</h3>
We found that users wanted to simply press 'enter' once they had pasted the link instead of pressing the submit button so we enabled this action to make the process of uploading and sharing a video easier. 
<br>
<h3> 4. Forced recording </h3>
We added a feature that requires users to turn on the camera before they can watch the video. In the user tests we found many users did not know how turn the camera on so we added a very visible prompt. We also found that many users chose not to turn the camera on so we are hoping that these users will be convinced to be recorded because they want to watch the video. We want to see if users are comfortable with turning the camera on if it is required or if this will creep out the users who would have not turned it on in the last iteration.

<h3>5. Resize videos </h3>
We resized reaction videos relative to the youtube video and placed them on top of the youtube video. We found from testing that users were much more interested in watching their friends reactions than in rewatching the youtube video so we made the reaction videos the focal point once they appear
<br>
<h3>6. Clicking on reaction videos </h3>
Now when a user clicks on the youtube play button or on any of the reaction videos they all start to play. The most common 'mistake' users made in the test last week was to click on the reaction videos to make them play so this is clearly the most intuitive action for users.
<br>
<h3>7. Style </h3>
We added some styling and a logo to our page to make it look less spammy and to make users more comfortable recording themselves on our site. </h3>
<br>
<h3>8. Limit number of reaction videos to 3 </h3>
We found that users could not focus on more than 3 videos so we added a restraint that prevents more than 3 videos from being displayed at once. Because the videos are ephemeral the user can still send the video to more than 3 friends but only 3 reactoins can be displayed at once and later reactoins will not appear until the initial 3 are gone.  </h3>
<br>
<h3>9. Cookie storage </h3>
We added cookie storage for usenames to eliminate the need for users to remember their username in order to view their friends' reactions. Users can still change their username or view reactions from a different device if they remember their name, but the experience is now streamlined for the common use case where one user uses one computer to send the video and check responses. In this case the user can go directly to the reaction page without having to enter a name any time they view the page again. This was in response to the feedback from user testing where several users could not remember which name they entered and therefore had trouble logging back in to check the reactions. 
<br>
<h3>10. Small changes </h3>
We also made some small changes to text on the site to more clearly explain our features and to make buttons more intuitive.
