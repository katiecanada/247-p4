<h3> Storyboards </h3>
This week we tweaked our ideas from M1 and made storyboards out of the most promising ones. This is the week that our project idea began to take form.

<h3> Idea 1: Social Online Shopping </h3>
<p> This idea attempts to reconcile the disconnect between the social experience of shopping with friends and the solitary experience of online shopping. We want to create a solution where it is easy to communicate with friends while online shopping and share the experience with one another.<br>

<h3> Idea 2: Real-time Reactions to Content </h3>
<p> Often when you send a short youtube clip to a friend their reaction is much more interesting than the generic response they might send you (eg. hahahah). This project would seek to capture your friends' organic responses to a short video clip you sent them. The sender could then watch their friends' reactions alongside the original clip to see what they thought of it. If the user sent a link to a group of friends, they could see all of their friends' responses in one place. </p> <br>

<h3> Idea 3: Sharing the Experience of a Large, Public Event </h3>
<p> The experience of a concert affects many senses and emotions and can be very difficult to describe to friends with simply words or pictures. We imagine a solution where users can quickly and easily send a wide variety of media and concise text to share an event experience with someone else.  </p><br>
